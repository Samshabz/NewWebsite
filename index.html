      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>

        Hello! My name is Sameer, and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, focusing on the electric vehicle industry.
        <br><br>
        My academic journey showcases my dedication, with a 90% average in grade 12, a 70% average during my undergraduate studies, and an 80% mark on my thesis (where I tackled GPS spoofing). I've put these skills to use through various internships and contract positions.
        <br><br>
        
        Yet, my ambitions include more than simply my grades. My roles as a class representative, vice-chairman of a community service organization, teaching assistant, and tutor have helped me develop strong leadership and communication skills. These abilities were further enhanced through different projects and an international program, where I was proud to receive the Best Student Award. The blend of these experiences and the skills I've acquired has been crucial for my entrepreneurial efforts and building my network.
        <br><br>
        
        As I continue to grow and evolve, I hold onto two core principles: I will only take actions that contribute to my self-improvement and that embody the kind of behavior I wish to see in the world.

                My entrepreneurial journey began modestly, selling snacks and energy drinks to support students during exam seasons. I later ventured into creative pursuits, such as designing and selling custom patches, as well as offering audio and visual editing services using the Adobe Suite and knowledge gained from YouTube courses. My most ambitious project involved identifying and addressing a market gap for affordable yet high-quality perfumes, which I successfully imported and sold.
                <br><br>
                Although these ventures were not highly scalable, they provided invaluable lessons in market research, product variety, and effective sales techniques.
